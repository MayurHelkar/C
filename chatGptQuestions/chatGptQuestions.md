## 🧠 **Pointers in C — Detailed Tabular Notes**

| **Concept**                    | **Explanation**                                                               | **Syntax / Example**                  | **Important Notes / Memory Model**                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**                 | A pointer is a variable that stores the *memory address* of another variable. | `int *p;`  <br> `int a = 10; p = &a;` | `p` stores the address of `a`.                                        |
| **Address-of Operator (`&`)**  | Used to get the memory address of a variable.                                 | `p = &a;`                             | Returns address where variable `a` is stored.                         |
| **Dereference Operator (`*`)** | Used to access or modify the value at the address pointed by the pointer.     | `x = *p;`                             | If `p` points to `a`, then `*p` is equivalent to `a`.                 |
| **Declaration**                | A pointer must be declared with a type to match the variable it points to.    | `int *p; float *q; char *r;`          | Type ensures correct dereferencing.                                   |
| **Initialization**             | Assigning an address to a pointer.                                            | `int a=5; int *p=&a;`                 | Uninitialized pointers (wild pointers) can cause segmentation faults. |
| **NULL Pointer**               | Pointer that points to nothing (address `0`).                                 | `int *p = NULL;`                      | Used for safety — check `if(p != NULL)` before dereferencing.         |
| **Dangling Pointer**           | Pointer pointing to memory that has been freed or is out of scope.            | ```c                                  |                                                                       |
| int *p;                        |                                                                               |                                       |                                                                       |
| {                              |                                                                               |                                       |                                                                       |
| int x=10;                      |                                                                               |                                       |                                                                       |
| p=&x;                          |                                                                               |                                       |                                                                       |
| }                              |                                                                               |                                       |                                                                       |
| printf("%d", *p); // invalid   |                                                                               |                                       |                                                                       |

````| Avoid using local addresses outside their scope. |
| **Void Pointer (`void *`)** | Generic pointer that can point to any data type. | ```c
void *ptr;
int a=10;
ptr=&a;
``` | Must be typecast before dereferencing: `printf("%d", *(int*)ptr);` |
| **Pointer Arithmetic** | Can be used to traverse arrays. | `p+1`, `p-1`, `p++`, `p--` | Moves by size of data type. e.g., `p+1` moves 4 bytes for `int`. |
| **Pointers and Arrays** | Array name itself acts as a pointer to the first element. | ```c
int a[3]={1,2,3};
int *p=a;
printf("%d", *(p+1)); // 2
``` | `a[i]` is equivalent to `*(a+i)`. |
| **Pointer to Pointer (Double Pointer)** | Stores the address of another pointer. | ```c
int a=10;
int *p=&a;
int **q=&p;
``` | `**q` gives value of `a`. |
| **Pointer to Constant** | Pointer cannot modify the value it points to. | `const int *p = &a;` | You can change `p`, but not `*p`. |
| **Constant Pointer** | Pointer itself cannot change to point elsewhere. | `int * const p = &a;` | Can modify `*p`, but not `p`. |
| **Constant Pointer to Constant** | Neither pointer nor value can be changed. | `const int * const p = &a;` | Both read-only. |
| **Function Pointers** | Stores address of a function and allows calling it indirectly. | ```c
void hello(){printf("Hi");}
void (*fptr)() = hello;
fptr();
``` | Used in callbacks, event handling, and dynamic dispatch. |
| **Pointer to Array** | Points to an entire array. | `int (*p)[5];` | `p` can point to an array of 5 integers. |
| **Array of Pointers** | An array where each element is a pointer. | `int *arr[3];` | Common for strings: `char *names[] = {"A", "B"};` |
| **Dynamic Memory Allocation** | Pointers are used with heap memory via `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`. | ```c
int *p = (int*)malloc(5*sizeof(int));
free(p);
``` | Always `free()` after use to avoid memory leaks. |
| **Pointer Comparison** | Pointers can be compared using relational operators if they point into same array. | `if(p < q)` | Undefined if not same array. |
| **Pointer Casting** | Changing pointer type manually. | `char *c = (char*)&a;` | Used in memory-level manipulations. |
| **Pointer Size** | Depends on architecture, not data type. | `printf("%zu", sizeof(int*));` | 4 bytes (32-bit), 8 bytes (64-bit). |

## 🔍 **Memory Diagram Example**

**Code:**
```c
int a = 10;
int *p = &a;
int **q = &p;
````

**Diagram:**

| Variable | Stored Value | Points To | Address (example) |
| -------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| `a`      | `10`         | —         | `1000`            |
| `p`      | `1000`       | `a`       | `2000`            |
| `q`      | `2000`       | `p`       | `3000`            |

Dereferencing:

* `*p → 10`
* `**q → 10`

## ⚠️ **Common Errors and Precautions**

| **Error Type**      | **Cause**                             | **Example**                 | **Fix**                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Wild Pointer        | Declared but not initialized          | `int *p; *p=10;`            | Initialize to valid address or NULL. |
| Dangling Pointer    | Memory freed but still accessed       | ```c                        |                                      |
| int *p = malloc(4); |                                       |                             |                                      |
| free(p);            |                                       |                             |                                      |
| *p = 10;            |                                       |                             |                                      |
| ```                 | Set pointer to `NULL` after `free()`. |                             |                                      |
| Memory Leak         | Allocated memory not freed            | `malloc()` without `free()` | Always pair with `free()`.           |
| Type Mismatch       | Assigning incompatible pointer type   | `int *p; float f; p=&f;`    | Match pointer and variable types.    |

## 🧩 **Advanced Use Cases**

| **Concept**                   | **Usage**                                         | **Example**                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Pointer to Function Array** | Used for dispatch tables / menu-driven programs.  | `void (*f[3])() = {add, sub, mul};`             |
| **Callback Functions**        | Functions passed as arguments to other functions. | `void process(void (*fn)()){ fn(); }`           |
| **Linked Lists / Trees**      | Pointers enable dynamic data structures.          | `struct node { int data; struct node *next; };` |
| **Pointer with Structs**      | Used to access members dynamically.               | `struct emp *e; e->id = 10;`                    |
| **Pointer Aliasing**          | Two pointers referring to same memory.            | `int *p=&a, *q=&a;`                             |
